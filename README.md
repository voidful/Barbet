# Barbet

Barbet is a Hugging Face Transformers implementation of the Barbet causal
language model family. The repository provides remote-code compatible modeling
classes and two production-oriented configuration presets: Barbet 300M and
Barbet 1B. The architecture mirrors the R2 revision of the
[Open Formosa](https://github.com/voidful/open_formosa) training stack
(Taiwan-Omni-300M-R2 / Taiwan-Omni-1B-R2).

This repository is intentionally lightweight. It contains model code and config
metadata, not training checkpoints or Megatron runtime artifacts.

## Contents

- `BarbetConfig`
- `BarbetModel`
- `BarbetForCausalLM`
- `configs/barbet_300m/config.json`
- `configs/barbet_1b/config.json`
- remote-code files for Hugging Face Hub loading:
  - `configuration_barbet.py`
  - `modeling_barbet.py`

## Model Summary

Barbet is a decoder-only hybrid language model with:

- grouped-query attention
- QK RMSNorm
- RoPE with large-context theta
- a repeating `global, sliding, sliding, mamba` layer motif
- local sliding-window attention layers
- SwiGLU feed-forward layers
- tied token embeddings and LM head (R2 rebalance: the saved vocab budget
  funds extra depth)
- the frozen `voidful/PangolinTokenizer` vocabulary (114944 padded entries)
- incremental decoding with a hybrid KV/conv-state cache (rolling window for
  sliding layers, O(1) Mamba steps)
- optional multi-token prediction loss for training
- optional QK logit clipping and learnable attention sink (off in the shipped
  R2 configs, matching the validated upstream recipe)

The 300M config (20 layers, 8K context) is the proxy model family used for
systems validation. The 1B config (28 layers, 256K context) is the target
family configuration.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q
```

```python
from barbet import BarbetConfig, BarbetForCausalLM

config = BarbetConfig.barbet_300m()
model = BarbetForCausalLM(config)
```

## Hugging Face Loading

After a config folder and the remote-code files are uploaded to a Hugging Face
model repository, the model can be loaded with:

```python
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModelForCausalLM

config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained("voidful/Barbet-300M", trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("voidful/Barbet-300M", trust_remote_code=True)
```

The config files under `configs/` already include the `auto_map` fields required
for remote-code loading.

- [Checkpoint Conversion](docs/checkpoint_conversion.md)
- [Long Context](docs/long_context.md)
- [Development](docs/development.md)

## Current Limitations

- The Mamba-style mixer is a deterministic PyTorch fallback so the HF model is
  self-contained. Kernel-backed Mamba can be wired later behind the same module
  interface.
- Megatron HybridModel checkpoints require a dedicated conversion script before
  they can be loaded by this Hugging Face implementation.
- Native 1M-context training is not a default config. The intended path is to
  validate a 256K base first, then use a verified external long-context
  expansion method.
